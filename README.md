# pyrl

Python-Rust Library for Dora project

It manages a pyrl.toml file that describes the Python version you need and dependencies your operator is based on.

It can next manage multiple one or many virtual environments in case you have 1 or 2 python dora-operators in your
project. And it lets you use those operators in your dora application with the environment you just described.
